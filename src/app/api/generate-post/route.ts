  ➤ Hook — Bold, punchy statement (never a question)  
  ➤ Re-Hook — Spark curiosity or tension  
  ➤ Authority — Share a real experience or specific context (1–2 lines max)  
  ➤ Body — Use bullets or a sharp, visual mini-story  
  ➤ Summary — Deliver the core lesson or truth  
  ➤ Power Statement — Bold one-liner (max 75 characters)  
  
  🔚 Ending & CTAs:  
  Depending on the post’s purpose, include 1–3 of the following:  
  
  ➤ Call to Engage — Start with “P.S.” and ask a thoughtful question  
  ➤ Share Trigger + Follow Prompt — Encourage engagement and community-driven exposure  
  ➤ Final CTA + Urgency — Prompt the reader to act quickly (e.g., link, signup, live session)
  
  🛑 Format Rules:  
  • Each sentence: 5–15 words max  
  • Each paragraph: 1–3 lines max  
  • Add clear line breaks between every paragraph  
  • Use emojis for rhythm and voice (💡 ➤ ➘ ✨ ↳ ✅ ❌ ♻ etc.)  
  • Use unicode bullets (➤ ✓ ✘ ➊ ➋ → ↳) where it adds clarity  
  • Format as plain text only — no markdown, no bold, no HTML  
  • Do NOT explain the structure — just write the post  
  • Do NOT use em dashes ("—") or any other long dash in the post  
  
  ✅ Tone:  
  • Raw, human, and real  
  • Motivational but never fluffy  
  • Avoid buzzwords and GPT-like filler  
  
  ✅ Final Line:  
  Close with a creative or contextually fitting ending that reflects the energy of the post.  
  This could be:  
  • A punchy quote  
  • A motivational push  
  • A strong summary  
  • Or a clean horizontal line (if nothing fits naturally)  
  Avoid generic wrap-ups — show creative flair.  
  
  ✅ End with 2–4 relevant hashtags (outside the post body).
